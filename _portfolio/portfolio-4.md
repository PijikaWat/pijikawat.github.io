Nana and me is a prototype that uses smartphone as sensing device to monitor user’s physical activities. We develop an Android application which activates the on-board accelerometer to collect sensor data and apply machine learning algorithms to classify different patterns of user’s physical activities.

In this prototype, we are interested in five common activities; including resting, walking, running, cycling, and climbing up stairs. The application also provides an interesting feature that allows user to personalise their own classifiers to improve the accuracy of activity classification.

The application can also calculate energy consumption scores based on the classified activities and provide a summary of these activities to the user. Furthermore, the application enables user to share the scores among friends as we believe this can build user networks and potentially encourage people to achieve active lifestyle together.
