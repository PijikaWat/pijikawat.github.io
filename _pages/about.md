My name is Pijika. I work as a researcher at Microsoft Research Cambridge, UK. My current research work is in the area of applied machine learning for healthcare and medicine. My past research experience include image classification, medical image search, mobile sensing for healthcare, distributed machine learning systems, and security in cloud applications.

Before I joined Microsoft Research, I finished my PhD at Imperial College London and my supervisor was Professor Peter Pietzuch, who leads Large-Scale Data & Systems (LSDS) group. Before my graduate school at Imperial College, I was trained as a medical doctor in Bangkok, Thailand. I practiced as a general practitioner and worked for GlaxoSmithKline (Southeast Asia).
